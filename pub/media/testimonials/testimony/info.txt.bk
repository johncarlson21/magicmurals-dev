Artifacturing.jpg	Jenna B., Interior Designer - Artifacturing - Rutherfordton, NC	Restaurant Updates	'Magic Murals was an integral part of the successful renovations at Mi Pueblito Mexican Restaurants in Western North Carolina! I was unable to find any table cloths that fit my vision and the tables were mismatched. Magic Murals was the perfect solution! I was able to design Talavera tile compositions to fit any table (size and/or shape) using the QuikStikvinyl. The prints were easy to apply and then I coated them with bar top epoxy which adhered well. The overall effect is stunning, rich in color and dimensional. Thank you Magic Murals, for making my vision a reality, staying in budget and meeting many deadlines.'	B	Custom Murals	/custom-wall-murals.html

Thank you for the quick shipment and the surprise to see our 84''x56'' Hilltop Villa II arrive in single panel mode. We definitely are happy with the single panel version! We decided to affix the mural directly on the wall and with the full depth of the frame visible, it looks great. Since the mural was inside the frame, I had to use additional masking tape to ensure the mural stayed up there since the mural wasn't flat and unencumbered on the wall as in a typical installation. That frame certainly made things more challenging but it sure looks good now! The top of the mural is about 16 feet off of the floor. Our Little Giant Classic 26 Ladder with two work platforms gave me a very stable perch to perform the install. We couldn't be happier with the results! Thanks again for going the extra mile for us.

I'm a scuba diver, I love the ocean, and I did my Master's thesis on a coral reef fish, the Bluehead Wrasse, so what I'd always wanted more than anything was an ocean/ Finding Nemo themed nursery! Your mural was the perfect way to make it all come together! :) I also found these Finding Nemo decal stickers (not very sticky and meant to be removed and moved often, so I don't think they'll damage the mural) on-line, and hid the little characters in the reef on the mural. Now that he's a little older, Evan just loves looking at the mural, and finding the Nemo characters hidden in it! He points at them and gets very excited and babbles! Anyway, we couldn't be happier with our mural - please thank everyone at your company for us! :) Thanks again!'

PaulL.jpg	Paul L.	Outside the Box	For creative types, it can be stifling to just sit at the computer and stare at a white screen when you're trying to come up with your next big idea. Murals are a great way to create a space where you can not only think outside the box, but about 30 feet above it! Search through our collection and find a mural that will inspire you.	R		
JulieS.jpg	Julie S. - Sterling, CO	Man Cave Makeover	Whether it's a man cave or the family rec room, your room gets a little extra 'rumpus', with a mural that reflects your interests and/or your attitude.

JillS.jpg	Jill S. - Chicago, IL	Skyline Decor	Jill found her favorite city among our collection of Skylines and Cityscapes.

JeromeB.jpg	Jerome B. - Shelby Twp, MI	Brick Wall	Jerome found the brick wall in our collection of patterned wall coverings was the perfect complement to his vintage arcade games and 'Vacation' movie posters. Nice man cave, Jerome, very nice. Man cave, mom cave or family room...we've got you covered (and your walls, too, of course).	R	Brick Wall Texture, Custom	/brick-wall-texture.html

GeorgeT.jpg	George T.	City Lights Rec Room	Whether George lives in New York City or Peoria, Illinois, he's always playing billiards in Brooklyn. It's amazing how many of our customers have pool tables; color us jealous. While you're doing that, add some color and excitement to your game room.

MonsterBattingCage.jpg	Monster Batting Cages - North Carolina	Branded Signage	When our products are hanging in homes, we call them murals. When our products are hanging in businesses, however, we call them your money-makers. As a retailer or service provider, you need to take every opportunity to build your brand and cement that bond you have with your customers. Signage like this goes a long way toward helping you do that.	B	Teammates, Custom Mural	/teammates.html, /custom-wall-murals.html
DorothyP.jpg	Dorothy P.	A Change of View	We've been framed!!! Like Dorothy, a number of designers and homeowners use our murals as a base from which to create a real change of view. Outdoor vistas framed in windows, undersea fish framed in aquariums -- your imagination is the only limit. Adding a window frame to a mural is a great way of creating the illusion that you're not in a windowless space.	R	Custom Mural	/custom-wall-murals.html
CindyM.jpg	Cindy M.	A Broad Broadway Wall	A really long wall presents design problems and design opportunities. When the wall spans two areas, like a living space and dining space, a full length mural can really tie the two together. Cindy really jazzed up her space with this huge mural of Broadway, sans neon lights and done in black & white. We'd love to see how she furnished the place -- it could be a bedroom, a rec room, a dance studio or anything else. Send us a pic, Cindy.	R		
ChristinaW.jpg	Christina W. - Monroe, NC	Color Me Wall	It's okay to let your kids color on the walls... when it's one of our 'Color Me' murals, that is.

SpaRetailer.jpg	Luxurious Showroom Displays	Showrooms and Trade Shows	With the help of one of our murals, this spa retailer created a display so inviting that even people without the space for a hot tub want one.

AimeeF.jpg	Aimee F. - Santa Monica, CA	Mirror Image Murals	Kudos to Aimee for really using her imagination in decorating her soccer fans' bedroom. She used two versions of the same mural to create this wonderful effect: one original and one produced in mirror orientation. One mural; twice the impact. Is there a room where you'd like to create a reflective illusion and visually increase your space?	R	Splatter Soccer	/splatter-soccer.html
SaraT.jpg	Sara T. - East Norwich, NY	Kitchen Decor	I gave the 'Chef on Pig' mural to my husband for Christmas knowing it was as much for me as for him.

SteveC.jpg	Steve C. - Fernandina Beach, FL	Surfer's Surprise	It was a Christmas surprise for my 11 year old daughter. While she was visiting other family we remodeled her room and added the mural to top off the surf theme we were working on. She was thrilled and absolutely loved the mural. The ordering process was easy, shipping was fast and the quality of the mural exceeded my expectations. I was also worried about applying it and it turned out to be very easy. Once I had my measurements squared away I did it by myself in less than 5 minutes. No creases or air bubbles. Thanks for a great product!!'	R	Palm Van	/palm-van.html

Thanks for such a great product!'	B		
AmandaH.jpg	Amanda H. - Greenville, SC	High End Retailer	The Denim Salon provided the picture and we produced the mural.

BradR.jpg	Brad R. - Salt Lake City, UT	Custom City Skyline	A custom mural featuring your city's skyline, a historic landmark or an iconic scenic view is an excellent way of creating a welcoming space in many environments. They work in a home, but do double duty in municipal offices, professional offices of lawyers, accountants, etc., schools, assisted living facilities and elsewhere. If we don't have your favorite city in our collection, let us know and we'll get it.	B	Custom Mural	/custom-wall-murals.html

DavidV.jpg	David V. - Virginia Beach, VA	Cozy, Comfortable & Custom	When we say installation is easy, we really mean it. David had this custom mural created and tells us: 'I have greatly enjoyed having this image on the wall. Now with the experience of having done this once, I look forward to the day of changing the image.' Good news for David -- we offer materials that are movable and re-positionable.

DonMF.jpg	Don Mc. - Murray, UT	Custom Reality	You have to look hard to spot the mural in this room. (Hint: It's the lockers!) The client furnished us with the image and we furnished them with a little piece of virtual reality. Make your own reality; create a custom mural for yourself. 'Here is an image of the mural that we purchased for our operating room simulation lab. It turned out great.' More traditionally, our customers tend to create virtual realities that simulate rooms on the beach, but we think the operating room is very cool.	B	Custom Mural	/custom-wall-murals.html
GregE.jpg	Greg E.- Enfield, CT	Ballplayer's Bedroom	My son LOVES his new bedroom thanks to the mural you created from my photo. It looks so real people can't believe the Section 19 sign is part of the graphic -- even standing only an arms length away! The installation was so easy and we hung it in less than 30 minutes. QuikStik was a breeze. I can't say enough positive things about my entire experience with Magic Murals. Everyone was so friendly, helpful with all of my questions and genuinely took a personal interest in making sure my son has the coolest room ever.' Can we say: 'Coolest Dad ever!'

The staff has not stopped complimenting... it really brought life to the room!! Thanks again.'	B		
KimS.jpg	Kim S. - Southern Pines, NC	Custom City Shot	I love my mural!! I wanted to have a big city feel in my newly remodeled art studio. I had just been to NYC and took some photos looking out from Rockefeller Center, so I sent one to be blown up to 10 feet wide. The service was friendly and conscientious and I received my order in the initially quoted time frame. I ordered the QuikStik so it could be easily removed if needed. It was pretty easy to install and the decal is very sturdy, which was good because I worried about it tearing with such a wide width. I love the way it looks and I really do feel like I'm in the Big Apple!'	R	Custom Mural	/custom-wall-murals.html
LorraineB.jpg	Lorraine B. - Catonsville, MD	Elegant Nature	Lorraine used our 'Poplar Sunrise,' mural to add some elegance, some nature and the illusion of sunlight to this basement bedroom retreat. Very cleverly, she took one mural, split it, and used it on two different sections of wall. The results were great. Lorraine tells us: 'This is a basement bedroom. The murals brought the outside in, and the results are lovely. Can't thank you enough.'	R	Poplar Sunrise	/poplar-sunrise.html
NancyR.jpg	Nancy R. - Virginia Beach, VA	Waterfall Headboard	Instead of a headboard and a blank wall, Nancy created a beautiful view. 'My husband and I loved this mural. I think that normal bed frames are boring so I created a window with this beautiful mural as our view out. Everyone that has seen it has loved this idea and asked if I could do it for them. I told them all you need is a great mural. Thank you for helping to make a great idea even better.'	R	*Custom Mural	/custom-wall-murals.html
PaulB.jpg	Paul B. - Wheat Ridge, CO	Dental Office	Want to tell the world that the care you provide is out of this world? Then do what Dr. B. did and bring the cosmos into your treatment rooms.

Imagine gazing at this mural after a few hits of the nitrous.	B	Cosmic Adventure	/cosmic-adventure.html
StanleyD.jpg	Stanley D. - Baltimore, MD	Restaurant Revelry	The mural is a collage of Old New York City pictures that was designed many years ago. We were able, through our Graphic Artist, to redo the mural to be 45 feet long and 6 foot high for a new Goldberg's New York Bagels that recently opened in Timonium, MD. Your company, Magic Murals, was very easy to work with and very accommodating. The price was very fair as well. If I had to grade your work from one to ten, where ten was perfect, you have a twelve in my book.'	B	Custom Mural	/custom-wall-murals.html
SteveL.jpg	Steve L. - St. Petersburg Beach, FL	Window Dressing	Smart retailers know that in order to sell to a new customer, you first have to get them to walk inside your door.

Steve found a great match between his beachy merchandise and one of our tropical murals.	B		
StormyS.jpg	Stormy S.- Tooele, UT	Den or Dugout?	Babe Ruth always liked a good game, but a pool cue isn't the stick he was most famous for holding.

I hope your customer base grows and grows because your product ROCKS!'	R	Babe Ruth and the Gang	/babe-ruth-and-the-gang.html
TracyE.jpg	Tracy E.	Talk to the Animals	In a child's room, the best thing a mural can do is help stimulate the imagination. In a nursery, it could be cute animals; in an older child's room, a world map (we have special maps just for kids). Tracy shares: 'We love the mural and our baby boy loves it too! He lays in his crib and intently stares at all of the animal faces, and sometimes he babbles away to them as if he's trying to tell them a story. The application procedure was easy to follow and once we got the hang of it, it was quite simple.'	R	Animals of the Wild	/animals-of-the-wild.html

CandieN.jpg	Candie N. - Spencer, IA	Gorgeous Garages	If you have a classic car like this one in the garage, then you surely have to dress up the space. If you have something more modest under the roof, though, nothing is stopping you from treating her right. 'It turned out awesome! I ordered from 3 different companies to get the pictures I wanted. Your paper is the most beautiful on the wall as it dried very nice. It was a little tricky getting it straight as the walls are 10 feet tall so that made it harder. All in all it was a fun experience and my garage looks awesome. Thank you and I will be in touch.'	R		
CherylN.jpg	Cheryl N. - Fort Pierce, FL	Window to Another World	When you have a 'window,' with a custom view like this, it might be a little disappointing when you actually walk outside and find the weather's not quite so nice and there's no beach at all. 'Our mural arrived safe and sound, and we love it! I wanted this long wall to appear to have windows, so I cut the mural in half and framed it in to match our woodwork! Love the peel and stick! Will order from you in the future, great service, beautiful product!'	R		
ColleenP.jpg	Colleen P. - Carolina Beach, NC	Beach Retreat	A small mural like this installs in minutes and adds a whole other dimension to your space. In less time than it takes to make a reservation at an ocean resort you can create your own beach retreat to escape to any time you want. It's a whole lot less expensive too.	R		
CarrieT.jpg	Carrie T. - Long Beach, CA	Truly Tropical	You probably wouldn't be surprised to hear that our Beach and Tropical murals are among our most popular. What is surprising, however, is that so many of the people who order them live near the beach. We guess there's never too much of a good thing. We do see an uptick in orders from the snow belt during the winter months. It's a great way to warm up a room without adjusting the thermostat.	R		
DaveC.jpg	Dave C. - Evansville, IN	Model Train Topographies	We really have to applaud Dave for the wonderful job he did in creating the perfect hobby room to complement his awesome model train configuration. The set-up looks even more realistic with the wild west panorama wrapped along the back walls and serving as a backdrop.	R		
DavidS.jpg	David S. - Sandy, UT	Room With a View	Some rooms just don't have the view we wish they had. And some rooms don't have a view, or even a window, at all. Like David, you too can create a grand illusion in your basement family room. What do you want to look out and see? Aspen woods, a city skyline lit up at night, or even tropical fish... perfect for creating a sunken living room.	R	Custom Mural	/custom-wall-murals.html
DawnO.jpg	Dawn O. - Ducommun Incorporated	Wall of Honor	This picture pretty much speaks for itself, doesn't it? When Ducommun Incorporated was looking for the perfect backdrop to create a display honoring their employees who were deployed and serving their country, they chose this stars and stripes mural to do so. If it were up to us, we'd carve the likeness of every soldier right onto Mount Rushmore (which, by the way, is also available in our 'America' subject portfolio).

He tells us, 'I've attached a few pictures of the mural in place. It's supposed to look like you're standing on a porch looking out over the prairie. The door is a screen door that actually goes into a storage area. I'm very satisfied with the mural.'	R	Custom Mural	/custom-wall-murals.html

We had a professional paper hanger install the mural behind the baptistry, so it would appear that water is flowing into the Baptistry, and candidates would appear to walk down the river bank into the water for Baptism. It works wonderfully. We ordered the 8' x 12' mirror image (Tamgalla Waters at Sunset-FOT 58403155) to be sure enough of the water would be positioned to achieve the effect we wanted. We then painted extensions of the landscape on the far left and far right sides of the mural so no one would see a blank wall on either end of the picture.

Flyclops.jpg	Dave M., Flyclops, LLC - Philadelphia, PA	Amazing, Big, Portable (and Cheap!) Whiteboards	Every business needs whiteboards - large whiteboards. We wanted whiteboard space at least 3' x 5' and we wanted several of them. The prices were in the $250-700 range, and were flimsy whiteboards requiring wall mounting to have any real sturdiness or stability. So we got creative, and have some sweet whiteboards to show for it. We decided we wanted them to be portable (we work at Philly Game Forge and our desk situation is constantly evolving), large, and most importantly, resilient and self-supporting. We found this great company - Magic Murals - that sells custom-sized white-board roll-on material that is thick and beautiful. The price was right, so all we needed was something to make in to a whiteboard. We headed to Home Depot and bought ourselves a couple of doors. 32in x 80in was a nice size, and two of them side-by-side would be brilliant. Next we special-ordered the white-board material from Magic Murals. We bought it oversized, of course, 7' x 3' (or 84in x 36in) so when we applied the material we would have overhang we could trim later. A quick sanding of the door surface (and some wiping clean with a damp cloth), and the door was ready for application. We laid out the material, and peeled off the back, using eraser-blocks to smooth the material on to the doors. After it was all applied, we let the glue cure to the door, and then using a utility knife, made quick work of trimming the material to the door size. That was it! Now we have two large (7.5' x 2.5') white boards that cost $111 each, that we can use in a variety of ways. Want a huge surface? Put them next to each other. Multiple meetings? Split them up and move them to different locations. You can flip the boards to make use of the whole vertical space. You could even mount a rail on the wall, and lift the whiteboards in to place in a conference room. It's the flexibility of use that makes them amazing. Most importantly, if as we put these through their paces, we really really love them, we'll order more material and apply it to the back side of the doors, thus making the whiteboards dual-sided as well. We couldn't be happier. We'll post an update in a few weeks to let you know how they're standing up.'	B	Plain White Dry Erase	/plain-white-dry-erase.html

PatriciaU.jpg	Patricia U. - Beverly, MA	A Mural Installation Through a Window	I'm really pleased with the mural and how easy it was to install. Since my installation was not ordinary, what I did was mount the mural on a 1/8 inch thick piece of masonite (which was only $7.00 at my local Home Depot). I did this by just rolling it out onto the cut-to-size masonite as I peeled off the back. Perfect the first time! Then I screwed the masonite onto the back of a window I saved when I got replacement windows. I then screwed the whole window frame into studs, and the whole process took less than the afternoon. I wanted a mural, because the long wall needed something large, and I chose this particular mural, because I wanted something darker to balance out the heavy dark brown leather sectional (dog trampoline). And since we live on the coast, the sailboat was very appropriate. I hope you like it.'	R	Sailboat at Sunset	/sailboat-at-sunset.html

KhalidM.jpg	Khalid M. - Luton, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom	Stairway to Vegas	Take a look at my recently installed mural.  Wow, looks awesome and the size was cut to perfection. As with all building tolerances, walls are never straight. I have finished this install with a one inch silk, black border. Thank you very much!'

CarolL.jpg	Carol L. - Oreland, PA	Bringing Life to a Dark Space	I am buying a house with a small dark windowless bathroom in the basement. To spruce it up I bought an old window frame to put in front of the mural giving the appearance of a great view. It's not installed yet but I laid it out in the floor and snapped this pic.' We think this will be a great addition to your basement bathroom Carol! What a way to freshen up a dark space!	R	Horseshoe Bend at Sunset	/horseshoe-bend-at-sunset.html
AndyG.jpg	Andy G. - Sun Prairie, WI	What a nice garage!	The first mural was the Royal Corvette in the small size. I ordered one and also another mirrored. They were trimmed removing the windshield and the top part of the mural. (Otherwise it would have looked like there were two windshields.) I then played with where to match them up. Never could get them quite perfect as you can see by the grille teeth but they are close enough for a garage. I am very happy with how easy these were to install. I did find that the little felt squeegee you send with the murals streaked the finish of the material. Maybe I was rubbing too hard. I ended up doing it with my hand instead. Didn't have any bubbles to remove. It is a two person job to hang these and I am glad I had my wife to help.'	R	Royal Corvette	/royal-corvette.html
BonitaK.jpg	Bonita K. - Bennington, NE	Feeling Peaceful	Please see the attached photo of our project featuring your 'Peaceful Pasture' mural. The window frame was salvaged from a building on a farm in Pierce county Nebraska that has been in my husband's family for well over 100 years. We really like the way it turned out.'

CassidyS.jpg	Cassidy S. - Southbury, CT	Underwater Dream Room	What a wonderful way to add depth to your bedroom. Cassidy did just that with this 'Keiki Turtle' Magic Mural.

DougC.jpg	Douglas C. - Nfocus Consulting, Inc. - Lancaster, OH	Post Office or Hallway?...	This mural is in the hallway, heading to our Data Center. Within this hallway, we have relocated and reconstructed a Post Office from the 1860's, thus why we were looking for the antique postal theme. The felt squeegee in the tube made it easier to rub out the bubbles. It took two of us about 45 minutes to put this up.' Well we think this looks great and what a wonderful way to continue your vision with this mural!	B	Custom Mural	/custom-wall-murals.html

JillB.jpg	Jill B. - High Country Real Estate - Burney, CA	Burney Falls	We are very excited about our Burney Falls Mural. Burney Falls is our main tourist attraction. President Roosevelt called them the 8th Wonder of the World, and rumor has it Johnny Weissmuller dove off them for a Tarzan movie. He told them 'You better get it right the first time, because I'm only doing it once'. Our wall was shorter than the mural size we ordered and we really didn't want to just throw away the excess, so I ran it down the narrow space on the adjoining wall. The result is awesome... gives a 3D feeling when you look at the mural. Thank you so much for the beautiful job. We had fun hanging it around our alarm system and light switch (relied on the ole wall paper hanging skills).'	B	Burney Falls	/burney-falls.html

LindaA.jpg	Linda A. - Elkins Park Presbyterian Church - Elkins Park, PA	A Craft to Finish Off the Day!	We used the mural last week in the Craft Room during our week-long Vacation Bible School program at church. After the kids finished their craft project, they went over to the wall and used crayons to color the mural. The kids ranged in age from pre-k (3-4 years old) to 4th grade. Some of the teenage, young adult and adult helpers also assisted. Attached is a photo of the finished product! Thanks so much for the quick and free shipping! Once we select our VBS theme in the spring of 2015, I'll certainly place another order!'	B	Pirate Captain	/pirate-captain.html

MatthewH.jpg	Matthew H. - Las Vegas, Nevada	A Custom Mural for a Custom Room	THANK YOU! I couldn't be happier with our not-so-recent purchase. We had to wait a virtual eternity to get the bathroom to a point where we could install our mural but the outcome was SO worth the wait I just had to share a photo. From a sentimental perspective, the shot was taken in Amsterdam and a tribute to my Dutch heritage. The photo is installed in our guest powder room (yes, that is a urinal) and everyone that visits is astonished at the quality. I was equally astonished at the ease of putting it up. Thank you again.

I had a side porch on my house that I enclosed to make a sitting room so I had to remove the kitchen window. I wanted it to look like the outdoors behind my house so I put the mural where the window used to be. Put up some shutters and it looks like you're looking out into my back yard.

I ripped apart his room, painted, new bedspread/sheets and put up the mural!!! He is going to FLIP when he sees it!!! He's read everything there is about Mt. Everest and alpine climbing so this was the only thing to put on his wall! I'm sorry the picture is not better but I did want you guys to know how great a product you have.' Thanks Teri!

Just took this mural down and realized that I bought it two years ago, yet never sent in a photo. My husband tacked the mural to the wall so we could save it then framed it in with trim and Plexiglas to make a fake window. Our daughter then added a couple fairies to it that glow in the dark.
