My budget is very small so I just kept coming back to look at the beautiful murals and hoping the day would come that I could afford one. I subscribed to your newsletter and often returned when you offered discounts to look for the perfect mural but it was so hard to choose!<p>Recently I discovered your clearance pages and you offered an extra discount for Easter so I could not resist making a choice. It still wasn't easy, they are all so awesome!</p><p>The mural was so easy to hang! When my students arrived on the first morning after it was put up they were thrilled! Here are some of their comments: 'I could look at this all day!', 'I always wanted this!', 'This is so cool', 'I love it!'. They named all of the dolphins within an hour!</p><p>Thanks for the great service and the outstanding product. I am already dreaming of my next mural!!!!</p>",B Sc,Blue World-The Rainbow II (Clearance),/blue-world-the-rainbow-ii.html
